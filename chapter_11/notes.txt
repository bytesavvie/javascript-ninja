                            ASYNC JavaScript

Governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete.

START SOMETHING NOW AND FINISH LATER

JavaScript is a sync language. Execute one statement at a time.
JavaScript is a Single Threaded language. Thread is ordered
sequance of statements. If one statement takes time, it stalls the time,
blocks the code. This is where Async code comes.

Since the statement is finishing later, we pass it a callback function as a
paramater, that callback runs and finishes later on, once the request is
complete.

We have the que, this time when we come to that statement, browser takes
that request and handels it outside of the scope of single thread, in another
part of the browser. Also takes callback function to execute when the data
comes back. Beacuse it has been taken out of the thread, javascript can
carry on down the que. When it recives the data back and once the rest of the
functions have been executed, then we are allowed to call callback function
and finish the original function.

                            HTTP Requests

We make requests to get data from another server.
These requests are made to API endpoints. Endpoints are URL's that API or
server exposes. Servers responses with a response(data). We typically
get back selection of data in format of JSON.

XMLHttpRequest() creates request object.
Works with any kind of data.
This is used to send request to browsers, built in JS.
It has many methods.
open() method first fakes string, what method we are using, second
argument is where we want to make request to, what is the endpoint.
To send the request: request.send();
